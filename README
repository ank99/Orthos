Project Orthos - Greek Spell checking
=========================================================================================================
This is, primarily, a Greek language spell checking project.

This is based primarily on Hunspell/Aspell that provides the dictionaries and 
creates LibreOffice extensions.

It also incorporates (at least it aspires to) a Greek thesaurus.

Hopefully it will eventually provide spelling extensions for Mozilla projects also.
 
This was started as a fork of the LibreGreek GIT project at 
https://github.com/squibbylinux/LibreGreek. Read the README files there to find 
out more about the background of the project and the origin of its parts.

It is embarrasing that the Greek language support (spell checkers etc) have made 
so little progress in many years.
LibreGreek was at the time I got it the latest project and had most of the pieces 
required. In my search I found that it included the latest Greek language support 
files. Nontheless it was almost 3 years old and not maintained.

The objectives here are:
1. to *further* develop the Greek support for Hunspell in a more systematic way.
2. to collect, in a single project, the best support material for the Greek 
   language that the Greek FOSS community has produced so far for Libre Office 
   into a single project and make it easier to find and maintain
3. to maintain a, hopefully, standard Greek wordlist similar to the efforts made
   by other projects
4. to enhance the Greek dictionary with aff rules to make it easier to maintain
5. to eventually incorparate grammar rules and grammar checking
6. to develop/enhance a Greek thesaurus
7. To influence software development to incorporate features that suit the Greek 
   language

To install in LibreOffice
----------------------
The only file you need is orthosgreek-<version>.oxt
Install by using the Extensions manager.

===============================================================================

To recreate the LibreOffice dictionaries
-----------------------------------------
If you make changes to the dictionaries you can recreate the LibreOffice 
extensions by doing:

> make clean
> make all

If successful the procedure will clean and then recreate two files that can be 
installed by the extensions manager of LibreOffice:

1. orthosgreek-el_GR-<ver>.oxt
2. orthosgreek-el_GR-en_US-<ver>.oxt

The first one is a purely Greek dictionary for those that do not need English.
The second one is a combination of Greek/English dictionary.

Versions marked with a Greek α should be considered experimental.

Note: That there are some parts in the file structure that are not currently 
used and can be ingored. These will eventaully be used or cleaned.

WORD LISTS AND DICTIONARIES

Word Lists
--------------------
Word lists are just that - lists that include every possible word in all its forms.
There are no flags in the word lists. Word lists are processed by munch to create 
dictionaries.

el_GR.wl is the Greek word list

en_US.wl is the US English word list. It is created from the SCOWL word lists 
         (http://wordlist.aspell.net/) by using the command
         "mk-list -v2 american 70" which includes more than 160000 common words

Greek Dictionary
--------------------
The Greek dictionary is made from the original word list that was carried over from 
the original project (see above).
There are currently 828806 words in the dictionary but these include entries for
all the forms of the same word as produced by the Greek grammar rules. For exammple
the following are entered individually as different words:  ζητώ, ζητάς ... ζήτησα 
κλπ. κλπ. αναζητώ, αναζητάς κλπ κλπ. This approach is necesary to have a working 
dictionary at this stage. It is expected that this number will shrink considerably 
when a proper aff file is composed.

Greek-English Dictionary
------------------------
The Greek-English dictionary is prepared from the el_GR and en_US word lists and it is a
convenient alternative to the Greek dictionary for those that use regularly both languages
in the same document. 

================================================================================

How you can help
--------------------
By far the most time consumiung activity is to maintain a proper word list to 
be used by the dictionary. A word that is not in the dictionary cannot be spelled
checked. Please submit a bug report with any words you find we are missing.

Also anyone with professional language skills can prove invaluable for this project.
