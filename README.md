# Orthos
Orthos (Greek Ορθός) - correct, or (in our case) writing correctly or orthography.

This project contains Greek dictionaries and thesaurus that are primarily created 
for LibreOffice and OpenOffice. See the README file for more details.

To install in LibreOffice or OpenOffice just get one of the files 

orthosgreek-el_GR-(version).oxt - Greek dictionary
orthosgreek-el_GR-en_US-(version).oxt - Greek/English dictionary 

and install using the extensions manager. It is best to get these files from the latest release
which is the most stable. Files from the master code branch are in development and may or may
not work. 

The el_GR-en_US version is a combined Greek/English spelling dictionary that is very
usefull to anyone that works with multilingual documents.
